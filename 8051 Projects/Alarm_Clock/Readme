This is project titled "DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF MICROCONTROLLER  BASED DIGITAL CLOCK WITH ALARM"

ABSTRACT

This paper talks about the indigence of Real Time Clock (RTC) for maintaining real timing constraints 
for various specific applications. Real time Clocking is widely and generally used in various electronic 
appliances so that tracking the traces becomes versatile and flexible for security purpose. Digital cameras 
used RTC in it so that when the image is captured it will have details of, on which day and date it was 
captured for future reference. Such RTCs are very useful when it comes to the need of security, cogent 
evidence and investigations. Microcontroller AT89S52 is programmed using I2C Protocol with DS1307 RTC IC in 
such a way so as to maintain Real timing and same is displayed on LCD. The parameters can be varied by means 
of matrix keypad.
