Automatic Detection And Notification of Potholes and Humps on Road

Abstract

Many on-going projects in the field of vehicular networks are working in 
the direction of providing driver with relevant information about roads and 
traffic movements. One of the major problems in developing countries is 
maintenance of roads. Well maintained roads contribute a major portion to 
the country’s economy. And also many people are killed by unwanted potholes 
and humps on road. So Identification of pavement distress such as potholes 
and humps not only helps drivers to avoid accidents or vehicle damages but 
also helps authorities to maintain roads. The implementation of this service 
will provide users with valuable information about the conditions of roadways 
that will limit potential damage to the user’s vehicle or Maintenance Authority. 
This project proposes a cost effective solution to identify potholes and humps 
on roads and provide timely alerts to drivers to avoid accidents or vehicle damages, 
and also send a message to authorities. Ultrasonic sensor is used to identify potholes 
and humps and also to measure their depth and height respectively. The sensed-data 
includes pothole depth, height of hump.
